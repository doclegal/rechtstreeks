DV_Questions Flow: Legal Case Readiness Analyzer
Purpose
This workflow determines if a legal case is ready for drafting a summons (dagvaarding) in the Dutch legal system. If not ready, it generates domain-specific claim options, evidence plans, and clarifying questions in Dutch.

How It Works
The agent follows a simple decision tree:

Receive Case Data - The workflow receives case metadata through API launch variables
Evaluate Completeness - The logic router evaluates if all required elements are present
Generate Response - Based on completeness, the agent either:
Confirms readiness for summons drafting
Generates missing information, claim options, and questions
Return Structured Data - All outputs are returned in structured JSON format
Input Variables
The workflow accepts these launch variables from your Replit application:

case_type
 - Case category (arbeidsrecht, huur, consument, geldvordering)
legal_domain
 - Specific legal domain
facts_complete
 - Whether all facts are available (boolean)
evidence_complete
 - Whether all evidence is available (boolean)
evidence_missing
 - Array of missing evidence items
has_legal_basis
 - Whether the case has legal standing (boolean)
risk_level
 - Assessment of case risk (low, medium, high)
Plus additional metadata variables (see full specifications)
Output Structure
The workflow returns a structured JSON response with:

ready_for_summons
 - Boolean indicating if summons can proceed
next_flow

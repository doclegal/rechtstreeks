Title: Deprecate current Summons UI and prepare blank “Summons Editor” page (keep all other features working)

Goal
We’re changing how the summons is generated. For now, completely remove the existing Summons editor UI and leave a clean, empty “Summons Editor” page as a placeholder. Do not break any other areas of the app.

Scope (what to do)

Remove/disable the current Summons UI

Hide and remove all components, buttons and blocks under the Summons area, including:

Procedurepositie

Dagvaarding template

Template details

Hoe werkt het

The current fillable summons document/editor

Remove associated state, handlers, and dead routes for these components.

Keep the rest fully working

“Mijn zaak / My Case”, “Analyse / Analysis”, and “Brieven / Letters” must remain 100% functional.

Do not remove shared utilities, stores, or API calls used by those sections.

Leave a blank placeholder page

Keep the route/menu item “Dagvaarding Editor”.

Render a minimal placeholder (title + short note: “Coming soon”).

No actions, no forms.

Code cleanup

Remove dead imports, unused hooks/state, and orphaned styles related to the old Summons editor.

Delete obsolete helper functions and constants that are not used outside the Summons area.

If a helper is shared, keep it and move it to a neutral/shared location.

Feature flag (defensive)

Add a simple feature flag (e.g., SUMMONS_UI_ENABLED=false) so the old UI cannot reappear by accident.

Ensure the placeholder page shows regardless of the flag; the flag only controls legacy code paths (which should be removed now, but keep the flag guard for safety in case of cache/rollback).

QA & non-regression

Verify navigation still works and there are no console errors.

Confirm environment variables and API clients are unchanged.

Run existing tests; add a smoke test that navigates to “Dagvaarding Editor” and sees the placeholder text.

Check that “Analyse” can still call MindStudio and render responses.

Check that “Brieven” still creates, previews, and saves letters.

Out of scope (don’t do now)

Do not add the new section-by-section summons builder.

Do not change any MindStudio flows or API schemas.

Acceptance criteria

The old Summons editor UI and all its controls are gone.

The “Dagvaarding Editor” route renders a clean placeholder only.

“Mijn zaak / My Case”, “Analyse / Analysis”, and “Brieven / Letters” behave exactly as before (no regressions).

No unused imports or dead code from the legacy Summons UI remain.

No new TypeScript/JS/console errors or failing tests.

Feature flag present and set to false by default.

Rollback plan

Create a branch before removal. If anything breaks outside Summons, revert quickly to that branch.

Keep a copy of the removed components in a legacy/ folder in the branch (not in main) for reference if needed later.

ou are updating the existing app that searches a vector database (Pinecone) with two namespaces:


ecli_nl


web_ecli


Goal


Adjust the search so that it always queries both namespaces.


Redesign the UI into a very minimal, clearly separated view per namespace.


Keep all found results persistently visible per namespace (do NOT clear them after a new search or generation).



Backend / Search behavior


There are two namespaces in the vector database: ecli_nl and web_ecli.


When the user performs a search, the app must:


Run a search in ecli_nl with the query.


Run a search in web_ecli with the same query.

This is the same search. If no matches found, there is nothing to show.




Store the results for each namespace in separate state containers, e.g.:


ecliNlResults


webEcliResults




Make sure that search, “generate reference”, and “delete” actions are scoped per namespace.
Actions in ecli_nl must never touch web_ecli results, and vice versa.



UI – Main screen
On the main jurisprudence screen, show two separate blocks/cards:


Block 1: “Uitspraken uit ecli_nl”


Block 2: “Uitspraken uit web_ecli”


For each block on the main screen:


Show:


A title that clearly indicates the namespace.


A short line with e.g. “X uitspraken gevonden” (based on the current state for that namespace).




Each block is independently clickable/openable from the home screen, so the user can open:


Only the ecli_nl results, or


Only the web_ecli results.




Keep the visual design very minimalistic and clean:


No heavy styling, just clear typography and spacing.


Two clearly separated cards/sections, stacked under each other.



UI – Inside each namespace block
When the user opens a block (for either ecli_nl or web_ecli), show:


Three buttons at the top (for that namespace only), with Dutch labels:


"Zoeken"


"Genereer verwijzing"


"Verwijder"




Under the buttons, show the list of found judgments for that namespace:


Each judgment on its own row, under each other (vertical list).


Layout like the current screenshot style:


The main visible field is the “Uitspraak tekst” (summary/decision text).


If other metadata (e.g. ECLI, court) is already available in the app, keep the current style, but stay minimal.






Persistence of results:


When the user searches again within a namespace, the new results should replace or update the list for that namespace, but:


Do NOT clear the list automatically after using “Genereer verwijzing”.


Do NOT remove “Uitspraak tekst” after any action unless the user explicitly uses “Verwijder”.







Button behavior (per namespace)
All three buttons operate only on the current namespace block.


“Zoeken”:


Opens or uses a search input for that namespace.


Triggers a search only in that namespace (ecli_nl or web_ecli) and updates its own result list.


Does not affect the other namespace.




“Genereer verwijzing”:


Uses the selected judgment(s) from that namespace to call the existing “generate reference” functionality.


Keep using the existing data structure (including ECLI and court/instantie) already wired in the app.


After generating the reference, keep the judgment(s) visible in the list for that namespace.




“Verwijder”:


Clears or removes the results only for this namespace.


It must not affect the results in the other namespace. It must not affect the Pinecone database.





Constraints / Acceptance criteria


Searching must always support both namespaces:


Global/app search → queries both ecli_nl and web_ecli and updates the two blocks.


From inside a namespace block, “Zoeken” can be limited to that namespace only.




UI must clearly show:


Which results come from ecli_nl.


Which results come from web_ecli.




Results must remain visible until the user explicitly clicks “Verwijder” in that namespace.


Keep the implementation consistent with the current tech stack and state management already used in the app. Do not introduce a completely new framework; adapt the existing patterns.


If something in the current code conflicts with this design, refactor the minimal amount necessary to achieve:


Two clearly separated namespace blocks.


Separate state and actions per namespace.


Minimal, clean UI with the three buttons and persistent results per namespace.
